Description
The city is becoming busier and parking is getting more difficult. SimplePark offers a solution by making unused private parking spaces and charging stations accessible via our app. Renters find a place easily; owners earn extra income. In addition, SimplePark is the all-in-one parking app with extras such as on-street parking, parking garages and public charging stations.
